    "For this tutorial weâ€™ll consider the bacterium of [tut 1](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/willienicol/Biochemical-engineering-notes/blob/master/Tutorials/Tut%201.ipynb). _Actinobacillus succinogenes_ is a natural succinic acid producer under anaerobic conditions. Microbial production of succinic acid (or biosuccinic acid) as bulk chemical has taken off during the past decade and numerous organisms, natural and modified, are considered for commercial use. The diagram below show some of the applications of succinic acid, with the bioplastic and solvent applications having the largest bulk scale potential.\n",

    "The central carbon metabolism of _A. succinogenes_ is given below. You will note the reverse of the TCA cycle is used up to succinic acid (SA) and that oxaloacetate (OXA) is formed by carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and not from pyruvate like in eukaryotes. The PEP carboxylation step is also associated with the formation of ATP via the specialized enzyme [PEP carboxykinase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphoenolpyruvate_carboxykinase#/media/File:PBB_Protein_PCK1_image.jpg). Also note that pyruvate is oxidised via the pyruvate dehydrogenase as well as formate lyase route. All NADH and ATP is given on a molar basis of substrate except for the NADH in glycolysis where half a mole of glucose was used as indicated in the metabolic map.\n",
