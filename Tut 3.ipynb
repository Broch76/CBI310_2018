    "The production of 1,3 propanediol (PDO) by the company DuPont is one of the success stories of bioproduction of polymer intermediates on a bulk scale. Read on the polymer [SORONA](http://www.dupont.com/products-and-services/fabrics-fibers-nonwovens/fibers/brands/dupont-sorona/articles/how-dupont-sorona-is-made.html) for some background on the process and final product.\n",

It is further given that biomass can be described by $CH_{1.91}O_{0.48}N_{0.22}$. The following yields are specified:\n",
